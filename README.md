# landing_page

Practiced the topics taught in the CSS and Flex section of The Odin Project. Copied the text provided in the example, but otherwise used my own styling to make the page shrink to a decent size when the browser shrinks while still looking readable.

Implemented vertical flex boxes, horizontal flex boxes, margin, and padding to get the webpage into the position I wanted, and used max-width, min-width, and width % to keep vertical flex elements sizing proportionally. Removed all flex-grow positive amounts because they didn't look visually appealing, but included some positive flex-shrink values. Mostly stuck to set amounts for flex-basis due to paragraph content making auto too wide for a centeral layout. Played around with different justify-content values, but found a mostly centeral theme to be the best fit to achieve the assignment desired result.

Haven't started on a variable lesson, but found those to be easier to use since a lot of design colors in the demo were the same.

For future self reference, overall had no need to reference back to previous lessons for information. The concepts I had to google were:
- font-weight limit (found this to be 100 to 900)
- how to size an image without ruining proportions (object-fit: cover (specifically) and object-position, though it does ruin the quality of the image.)
- Roboto google-font (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
